# MouseTool

Simple tool to get mouse coordinates/mouse position and that has a focused zoomed pic on it's position.
Useful to get a specific pixel's location for scripting and other stuff.

Nothing fancy, just a simple Windows Form program that displays those things and has a little zoom slider.

Decided to make this tool to become a bit more used to C#, as this is my first project in it. Hope that this may come in handy to someone.
